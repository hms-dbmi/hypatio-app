Finding patients for clinical trials is a challenge, as medical studies often have complex criteria that cannot easily be translated into a database query, but rather require examining the clinical narratives in a patient’s records. This is time-consuming for medical researchers who need to recruit patients, so often researchers are limited to patients who either seek out the trial for themselves, or who are pointed towards a particular trial by their doctor. Recruitment from particular places or by particular people can result in selection bias towards certain populations (e.g., people who can afford regular care, or people who exclusively use free clinics), which in turn can bias the results of the study (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/emj.20.1.54\" target=\"_blank\">Mann, 2003 </a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxn010\" target=\"_blank\">Genletti et al, 2009 </a>). Developing NLP systems that can automatically assess if a patient is eligible for a study can both reduce the time it takes to recruit patients, and help remove bias from clinical trials (<a href=\"http://amberstubbs.net/docs/AmberStubbs_dissertation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Stubbs, 2013 </a>).</p>\n<p>However, matching patients to selection criteria is not a trivial task for machines, due to the complexity the criteria often exhibit. For example, consider the phrase <em>“Patient must be taking aspirin for MI prevention.”</em> In this case, it is insufficient for a system to extract only the medication (i.e., <em>aspirin</em>); rather, the system must also determine the reason why the patient is taking the medication (i.e., <em>for MI prevention</em>). This shared task aims to identify whether a patient meets, does not meet, or possibly meets a selected set of eligibility criteria based on their longitudinal records. The eligibility criteria come from real clinical trials and focus on patients’ medications, past medical histories, and whether certain events have occurred in a specified timeframe in the patients’ records.</p>\n<h4>Data</h4>\n<p>This task uses data from the 2014 i2b2/UTHealth Shared-Tasks and Workshop on Challenges in Natural Language Processing for Clinical Data, with tasks on de-identification and heart disease risk factors (<a href=\"https://dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/programs/healthcare-data-science-program/clinical-nlp-challenges\" target=\"_blank\">learn more </a>). The data consists of nearly 300 sets of longitudinal patient records, annotated by medical professionals to determine if each patient matches a list of 13 selection criteria. These criteria include determining whether the patient has taken a dietary supplement (excluding Vitamin D) in the past 2 months, whether the patient has a major diabetes-related complication, and whether the patient has advanced cardiovascular disease.</p>\n<p>All the files have been annotated to indicate whether the patient meets, does not meet, or possibly meets each criterion. The gold standard annotations will provide the category of each patient for each criterion, as well as the spans of text that the annotators used to support their annotations. Participants will be evaluated on the predicted category of each patient in the held-out test data.</p>\n<p>The data for this task is provided by Partners HealthCare. All records have been fully de-identified and manually annotated for whether they meet, possibly meet, or do not meet clinical trial eligibility criteria.</p>\n<p><em>Data for the challenge will be released under a Rules of Conduct and Data Use Agreement. Obtaining the data requires completing a registration, which will start February 20, 2018.</em></p>\n<h4>Evaluation Format</h4>\n<p>The evaluation for both NLP tasks will be conducted using withheld test data. Participating teams are asked to stop development as soon as they download the test data. Each team is allowed to upload (through this website) up to three system runs for each of these tracks. System output is to be submitted in the exact format of the ground truth annotations, which will be provided by the organizers.</p>\n<h4>Dissemination</h4>\n<p>Participants are asked to submit a 500-word long abstract describing their methodologies. Abstracts may also have a graphical summary of the proposed architecture. The document should not exceed 2 pages (i.e., 1.5\" line spacing, 12pt-font size). The authors of either top performing systems or particularly novel approaches will be invited to present or demonstrate their systems at the workshop. A special issue of a journal will be organized following the workshop.</p>\n<h4>Organizing Committee</h4>\n<ul>\n    <li>Ozlem Uzuner, co-chair, George Mason University</li>\n    <li>Amber Stubbs, co-chair, Simmons College</li>\n    <li>Michele Filannino, co-chair, MIT</li>\n    <li>Kevin Buchan, SUNY at Albany</li>\n    <li>Susanne Churchill, Harvard Medical School</li>\n    <li>Isaac Kohane, Harvard Medical School</li>\n    <li>Hua Xu, UTHealth</li>\n    <li>Ergin Soysal, UTHealth</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>References</h4>\n<p>Sara Geneletti, Sylvia Richardson, and Nicky Best. 2009. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxn010\" target=\"_blank\">Adjusting for selection bias in retrospective, case-control studies</a>. <em>Biostatistics,</em> 10(1):17–31.</p>\n<p>C.

Chatlos Professor of Ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School. His vital research into retinitis pigmentosa (RP) yielded many important findings, including nutrition based approaches to slowing or stopping the effects of RP. This data set consists of 3 Clinical Trials conducted under Dr. Berson that detail treatment regimines for individuals with RP.<h3> Description of Clinical Trials Data </h3><h4>Trial 1 (1984-1991)</h4> 601 adults with typical RP were treated with either vitamin A palmitate 15,000IU per day on average or vitamin E 400 IU per day to assess impact on cone electroretinograms (ERGs), an established predictor of disease progression.  Patients treated with vitamin A showed a significant (P=0.01) slowing of retinal decline at the 99% confidence limit.  A subset of these patients (n=125) also showed a significant preservation of visual field as assessed by Goldmann visual fields assessment.  Longitudinal follow up over the 4-6 years of the study indicated that a dosage of 18,000 IU of vitamin A per day (15,000 IU by supplement combined with 3,000 IU by diet) provided the least decline in cone ERG. <br /> <br /> <i>Berson EI, Rosner B, Sandberg MA, Hayes KC, Nicholson BW, Beigel DiFranco C, Willett W. A randomized trial of vitamin A and vitamin E supplementation for retinitis pigmentosa. Arch Ophthalmol. 111:761-772; 1993.</i><h4>Trial 2 (1996-2001)</h4> 221 adults with typical RP were treated either with 1200 mg DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) capsules per day versus control capsules. Building on the previous study, all participants also received 15,000 IU of vitamin A palmitate per day. Although no benefit was observed with the combined vitamin A + DHA protocol, a subgroup of the controls revealed that those who ate 200 mg DHA per day through oily fish had a 40-50% slower loss of central visual field sensitivity on the Humphrey perimeter over four years as compared to those eating less than one serving of oily fish per week. <br /> <br /> <i>Berson EL, Rosner B, Sandberg MA, Weigel-DiFranco C, Moser A, Brockhurst RJ, Hayes KC, Johnson CA, Anderson EJ, Gaudio AR, Willett WC, Schaefer EJ.

Arch Ophthalmol. 122:1306-14; 2004.</i><h4>Trial 3 (2003-2008)</h4> 225 adults with typical RP were given either 12 mg lutein per day or a control tablet, all in addition to 15,000 IU of vitamin A palmitate per day. The lutein treatment group slowed loss of mid-peripheral visual field sensitivity (total point score) but did not preserve central field sensitivity. <br /> <br /> <i>Berson EL, Rosner B, Sandberg MA, Weigel-DiFranco C, Brockhurst RJ, Hayes KC, Johnson EJ, Anderson EJ, Johnson CA, Gaudio AR, Willett WC, Schaefer EJ.

NCAT GRDR repository will be a scalable, secure, and flexible integration architecture for clinical and biomedical datasets, which by extending the successful i2b2/tranSMART platform will allow data providers to easily share their data with the wider research community without requiring them to subscribe to proprietary vocabulary standards or to develop complex mapping protocols. Using federated data access and querying methods that retrieve relevant data from different locations before combining them, GRDR will make it possible for comparative analysis methods to be executed on the integrated datasets. By assigning generic identifiers (after de-identification) to related data across locations, GRDR will ease the difficulties of linking data while conforming to the requirements of patient data privacy and other security regulations.</i></div><br />",
