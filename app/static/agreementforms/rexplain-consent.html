            <p>We have invited you to take part in a research study because you have
              had a radiology examination and received a radiology report about your
              health condition.</p>

            <h3 id="what-should-i-know-about-a-research-study">What should I know

            <h3 id="why-is-this-research-being-done">Why is this research being
              done?</h3>

            <p>This study aims to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence
              (AI)-generated video reports on patient understanding of their radiology
              reports. By watching the video radiology reports, this study aims to
              determine whether this technology can transfer the information from the
              original text reports to a patient-centered, easy-to-understand way. The
              findings from this research will provide valuable information to guide
              the development and use of AI-assisted patient-centered radiology,
              possibly leading to improved patient care.</p>

            <h3>How long will I take part in this research?</h3>

            <p>Your participation will take approximately 20 minutes, including
              about 5 minutes to watch your video radiology report and about 15
              minutes to take a survey.</p>

            <h3>What will I be asked to do?</h3>

            <p>If you decide to participate, you will send us your radiology image
              (taken within the last two years) and corresponding report. You can send
              the digital documents to us through email, Google Drive, or any approach
              you prefer. You will then receive a corresponding video report. You will
              be asked to watch the video report(s) and complete an online survey for
              collecting your feedback on the video report(s).</p>
            <p>More detailed information about the study procedures can be found
              under the <em>“What can I expect if I take part in this research</em>?”

              there any way being in this study could be bad for me?</h3>

            <p>You will be asked to provide the following information: email
              addresses, age, sex, highest education, your radiology images and
              reports. We will also collect your feedback on the video reports and
              will use this information as a part of our analysis, but we will not
              publish or share the email addresses or any identifiable information
              with anyone outside of the research group. However, there is always a
              possibility that this information could be disclosed accidentally. Study
              staff are trained in privacy and confidentiality, and information will
              be stored securely, so we believe this risk is minimal.</p>
            <p>More detailed information about the risks of this study can be found
              under the <em>“What are the risks and possible discomforts?”</em>
              section.</p>

            <p>We cannot promise any benefits to you or others from your taking part
              in this research. However, possible benefits may include improved
              understanding of radiology images and contribution to research findings
              that will inform how AI is used in clinical practice.</p>

    <h3>Participation is voluntary</h3>
    <p>You are invited to take part in this research because you shared with
      us that you want to know more about your radiology results. It is your
      choice whether or not to participate. If you choose to participate, you
      may change your mind and leave the study at any time. Refusal to
      participate or stopping your participation will involve no penalty or
      loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</p>

    <h3>How many people will take part in this research?</h3>
    <p>About 5-10 people will take part in this research.</p>

    <h3>What can I expect if I take part in this research?</h3>
    <p>As a participant, you will be expected to complete the following.
      Once you have consented to participate, you will send us your radiology
      image (taken within the past two years) and corresponding report. If you
      have multiple radiology examinations within two years, you can choose to
      send one or multiple images and reports. If there is an old radiology
      examination used for comparison, you can choose to send the old
      radiology examination image(s) and report(s) to us as well. You can send
      these to us through email, Google Drive, or any other method you may
      prefer. For each radiology examination you send to us, you will receive
      a corresponding video report that was generated using AI. You will be
      asked to watch the video report(s) and complete an online survey to
      collect your feedback on the video report(s).</p>

<div class="row">

    <h3 id="what-are-my-responsibilities">What are my responsibilities?</h3>
    <p>As a participant, you are responsible for sending us your radiology
      image(s) and report(s), watching the AI-generated video report(s) we
      send back to you, and taking an online survey to record your experience
      with the video reports.</p>

    <h3>What are the risks and possible discomforts?</h3>
    <p>You will be asked to provide the following information: email
      addresses, age, sex, highest education, your radiology images and
      reports. Your identifiable information will be stored securely on our
      servers so that we can send you the generated video reports and collect
      your feedback. Your radiology data will be interpreted by qualified
      annotators (such as medical students under supervision of
      board-certified radiologists), but the annotators will only receive
      de-identified versions of your data with a code to link it back to you.
      We will securely store this code and will not share it with the
      annotators. We will not publish or share the email addresses or any
      identifiable information with anyone outside of the research group.
      However, there is always a possibility that this information could be
      disclosed accidentally. Study staff are trained in privacy and
      confidentiality, and information will be stored securely, so we believe
      this risk is minimal.</p>

    <p>Your identifiable information (including email address and contact
      details) and radiology data will be stored securely on our servers. We
      will use this information to share video reports and collect your
      feedback about these reports. Your radiology data will be interpreted by
      qualified medical personnel, but they will only receive de-identified
      versions of your data that are coded so that the study team can link it
      back to you. The code will not be shared with annotators.</p>
    <p>Data collected for study purposes will be used for research purposes

      could be used for future research studies or distributed to another
      investigator for future research studies without your additional
