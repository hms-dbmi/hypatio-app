      The n2c2 data cannot be redistributed in any way.  If you will be using/training a large language model in your intended research, please confirm that the LLM will not integrate the data such that a user of the model will have access to the n2c2 data.  Once you have done so, please indicate this in the research purpose of your application.  Thank you!
