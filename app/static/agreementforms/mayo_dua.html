	<p>1.1 <b><u>"Individually Identifiable Health Information"</u></b> means information that is a subset of health information, including demographic information collected from an individual, and (i) is created or received by a healthcare provider, health plan, employer, or health care clearinghouse; and (ii) relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual; the provision of healthcare to an individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care to an individual; and (a) that identifies the individual, or (b) with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the information can be used to identify the individual.</p>

	<p>1.2 <b><u>"Limited Data Set"</u></b> means Protected Health Information that excludes the following direct identifiers of the individual or of relatives, employers, or household members of the individual: (i) Names; (ii) Postal address information, other than town or city, State, and zip code; (iii) Telephone numbers; (iv) Fax numbers; (v) Electronic mail addresses; (vi) Social security numbers; (vii) Medical record numbers; (viii) Health plan beneficiary numbers; (ix) Account numbers; (x) Certificate/license numbers; (xi) Vehicle identifiers and serial numbers, including license plate numbers; (xii) Device identifiers and serial numbers; (xiii) Web Universal Resource Locators (URLs); (xiv) Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers; (xv) Biometric identifiers, including finger and voice prints; and (xvi) Full face photographic images and any comparable images.</p>

    <p>2 <b><u>Applicability of Terms; Conflicts.</u></b>  As of the Effective Date, this Agreement automatically amends all existing agreements between Recipient and Mayo involving the use or disclosure of a Limited Data Set for the Protocol.    In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between a provision of this Agreement and a provision of any other agreement between Recipient and Mayo regarding the Protocol, the provision of this Agreement shall control unless: (i) Mayo specifically agrees to the contrary in writing, or (ii) the provision in such other agreement establishes additional rights for Mayo or additional duties for or restrictions on Recipient with respect to a Limited Data Set, in which case the provision of such other agreement will control.</p>

    <p>3.5 <b><u>Agents and Subcontractors:</u></b>  Recipient will ensure that any agent, including a subcontractor, to whom it provides a Limited Data Set received from, or created or received by Recipient on behalf of, Mayo agrees to the same restrictions and conditions that apply through this Agreement to Recipient with respect to such information.</p>

	<p>5. <b><u>Term and Termination</u></b></p>

    <p>5.1 <b><u>Term.</u></b>  The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date, and shall terminate when all of the Limited Data Set(s) provided by Mayo to Recipient, or created or received by Recipient on behalf of Mayo, are destroyed or returned to Mayo, or, if it is infeasible to return or destroy the Limited Data Set(s), protections are extended to such Limited Data Set(s) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5.</p>

    <p>5.2 <b><u>Termination for Cause.</u></b>  As provided in HIPAA, including 45 C.F.R. §164.504(e)(2)(iii), upon Mayo's reasonable determination that Recipient has breached a material term of this Agreement, Mayo shall be entitled to do any one or more of the following: </p>

    <p>(a) Give Recipient written notice of the existence of such breach and give Recipient an opportunity to cure upon mutually agreeable terms.

    <p>(b) Immediately terminate any agreement between Mayo and Recipient which is the subject of such breach.</p>
    <p>(c) Immediately stop all further disclosures of Limited Data Set(s) to Recipient pursuant to each agreement between Mayo and Recipient which is the subject of such breach. </p>

    <p>5.3 <b><u>Effect of Termination.</u></b>  Upon receipt of written demand from Mayo, Recipient agrees to immediately return or destroy, except to the extent infeasible, all of the Limited Data Set(s) demanded by Mayo, including all such Limited Data Set(s) which Recipient has disclosed to its employees, subcontractors and/or agents.  Destruction shall include destruction of all copies including backup tapes and other electronic backup medium.  In the event the return or destruction of some or all such Limited Data Set(s) is infeasible, the Limited Data Set(s) not returned or destroyed pursuant to this paragraph shall be used or disclosed only for those purposes that make return or destruction infeasible.</p>

    <p>5.4 <b><u>Continuing Privacy Obligations.</u></b>  Recipient’s obligation to protect the privacy of the Limited Data Set(s) is continuous and survives any termination, cancellation, expiration, or other conclusion of this Agreement or any other agreement between Recipient and Mayo.</p>

In the event that any provision of this Agreement violates any applicable statute, ordinance or rule of law in any jurisdiction that governs this Agreement, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such violation without invalidating any other provision of this Agreement.  This Agreement may not be amended, altered or modified except by written agreement signed by Recipient and Mayo.  No provision of this Agreement may be waived except by an agreement in writing signed by the waiving party.  A waiver of any term or provision shall not be construed as a waiver of any other term or provision.  Nothing in Section 3 of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any legally-recognized claim of privilege available to Recipient.  The persons signing below have the right and authority to execute this Agreement for their respective entities and no further approvals are necessary to create a binding agreement.  Neither Mayo nor Recipient shall use the names or trademarks of the other party or of any of the respective party’s affiliated entities in any advertising, publicity, endorsement, or promotion unless prior written consent has been obtained for the particular use contemplated.  All references herein to specific statutes, codes or regulations shall be deemed to be references to those statutes, codes or regulations as may be amended from time to time.  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts which, when taken together, will constitute one original, and photocopy, facsimile, electronic or other copies shall have the same effect for all purposes as an ink-signed original. </p>
